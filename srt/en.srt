1
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:36,084
Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round.

2
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:42,834
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

3
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:49,384
I can't even get myself to move, slipping through the cracks of time.

4
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:56,917
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more.

5
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:59,917
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing?

6
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:03,167
Are my words useless even if I speak?

7
00:01:03,168 --> 00:01:09,921
I'm just tired of being sad, I should go on without feeling anything

8
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:17,051
Even if you give me the words I'm at a loss for, my heart just won't pay attention

9
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:23,552
If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark.

10
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:27,384
Is there a future for someone like me?

11
00:01:27,385 --> 00:01:30,883
Will I still exist in a world like this?

12
00:01:30,884 --> 00:01:37,883
Is this painful? Is it sad? Not even knowing myself.

13
00:01:37,884 --> 00:01:44,535
I'm just tired even of walking, I don't even understand people.

14
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:52,034
If someone like me can change, if I change, will it turn white?

15
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:13,367
Even in the midst of flowing time, oppression spins round and round.

16
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:20,367
I can't even see the heart that's leaving me, didn't you know?

17
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:27,220
I can't even get myself to move slipping through the cracks of time.

18
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:34,001
I don't know anything about what's around me, I'm just me and no more.

19
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:40,234
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing? Are my words useless even if I speak?

20
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:47,483
I'm just tired of being sad, I should go on without feeling anything.

21
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:54,384
Even if you give me the words I'm at a loss for, my heart just won't pay attention

22
00:02:54,385 --> 00:03:01,321
If I can move, if everything changes, it will go dark.

23
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:05,135
If I move, if I move

24
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:08,384
Everything will break, everything will break

25
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:11,875
If I'm sad, if I'm sad

26
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:15,384
Will my heart be able to turn white?

27
00:03:15,385 --> 00:03:22,135
I still know nothing about you, about me, about anything.

28
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:30,135
If I can open my heavy eyelids, if I break everything, turn black!!
